Early recognition: The CCU team, including intensivists, nurses, and respiratory therapists, should be vigilant in identifying patients at risk for sepsis based on clinical signs such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mental status. Laboratory tests, such as blood cultures and serum lactate levels, should also be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n","2. Rapid administration of antibiotics: Once sepsis is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered promptly, ideally within the first hour of recognition. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by the severity of sepsis, the likely source of infection, and the patient's allergies and sensitivities.\n","3. Supportive care: In addition to antibiotics, patients with sepsis require close monitoring and supportive care to maintain vital organ function. This may include mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and vasopressors to manage hypotension.\n","4. Serial assessment: The patient's clinical status should be assessed serially, at least every 4-6 hours, using a standardized scoring system such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) or the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA). This helps to identify early signs of organ dysfunction and guide management decisions.\n","5. Goal-directed therapy: The CCU team should aim to achieve specific goals for hemodynamic support, oxygenation, and ventilation. These goals should be individualized based on the patient's needs and monitored using bedside monitors and laboratory tests.\n","6. Close collaboration: The CCU team should collaborate closely with other specialists, such as infectious disease consultants and intensivist, to ensure that the patient receives optimal care.\n","7.

Initial assessment and resuscitation:\n","\t* Perform a rapid bedside evaluation, including vital signs, mental status, and physical examination.\n","\t* Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluids within the first hour of recognition.\n","\t* Achieve prompt fluid resuscitation with at least 30 mL/kg crystalloid within the first 6 hours.\n","3. Measurement of serum lactate levels:\n","\t* Check serum lactate levels within the first 2 hours of recognition and every 4-8 hours thereafter.\n","\t* Use a lactate threshold of >2 mmol/L to guide fluid management.\n","4. Management of vasopressors and sedation:\n","\t* Initiate vasopressor therapy if mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mmHg or serum lactate level >2 mmol/L despite fluid resuscitation.\n","\t* Use a vasopressor protocol to guide titration of vasopressors.\n","\t* Sedate patients with agitated delirium, but avoid deep sedation if possible.\n","5. Early source control:\n","\t* Perform early surgical source control within 8 hours of recognition for patients with suspected abdominal or pelvic infections.\n","6. Monitoring and adjustment of therapy:\n","\t* Closely monitor vital signs, laboratory values, and organ dysfunction scores (e.g., Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score).\n","\t* Adjust therapy based on the patient's response to treatment and any changes in clinical status.\n","7. Protocolized management of specific sepsis-induced organ dysfunctions:\n","\t* Manage hypotension with vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.\n","\t* Manage hyperglycemia with insulin therapy.\n","\t* Manage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with low tidal volume ventilation and conservative fluid management.\n","\t* Manage acute kidney injury (AKI) with fluid management and supportive care.\n","8. Early recognition and management of sepsis-induced cardiovascular dysfunction:\n","\t* Monitor for signs of cardiovascular instability, such as tachycardia, tachypnea, or hypotension.\n","\t* Manage cardiovascular dysfunction with vasopressors, fluid resuscitation, and inotropic support as needed.\n","9. Multidisciplinary team approach:\n","\t* Involve a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and critical care nurses, to provide comprehensive care.\n","10.

Early recognition and activation of the sepsis team: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment. Healthcare providers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of sepsis and activate the sepsis team immediately if they suspect sepsis.\n","2. Rapid administration of antibiotics: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends administering antibiotics within the first hour of recognition of sepsis, and ideally within 30 minutes if the patient is in shock or has severe organ dysfunction.\n","3. vasopressors for hypotension: Vasopressors should be used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mmHg in patients with septic shock. The choice of vasopressor should be based on the patient's clinical status and the presence of any cardiovascular instability.\n","4. Fluid resuscitation: Crystalloid fluids should be used for initial fluid resuscitation, and the goal should be to achieve a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) of 70% to 80%.\n","5. Monitoring for organ dysfunction: Sepsis can cause organ dysfunction, so it is important to monitor the patient's vital organs, such as the lungs, heart, kidneys, and liver.\n","6. Management of fever: Fever management is critical in sepsis patients, as high temperatures can exacerbate tissue damage. The goal should be to maintain a normal body temperature (36.5°C to 37.5°C) while avoiding hypothermia.\n","7. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels: Hyperglycemia is common in sepsis patients and can worsen outcomes. Blood glucose levels should be closely monitored, and insulin therapy should be initiated if the patient's blood glucose level is elevated.\n","8. Early recognition of sepsis in high-risk populations: Patients with high-risk conditions such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, and chronic liver disease are more susceptible to developing sepsis. Healthcare providers should be vigilant in identifying these patients and initiating treatment promptly.\n","\n","These are just some of the key points to consider when managing sepsis in a critical care unit.

Stop any bleeding: Apply direct pressure to the wound to stop any bleeding. Elevate the affected limb above heart level to reduce blood flow to the area.\n","2. Immobilize the leg: Use a splint or brace to immobilize the fractured leg and prevent further movement. This will help reduce pain and prevent further damage.\n","3. Assess for neurovascular injury: Check for sensation, motor function, and circulation in the affected limb. If there is any concern for nerve or vessel damage, call for immediate medical evacuation.\n","4. Manage pain: Administer appropriate pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to manage pain and discomfort.\n","5. Monitor for infection: Keep the wound clean and dry, and monitor for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or increased pain.\n","6. Provide rest and recovery: Encourage the patient to rest and avoid putting weight on the fractured leg. This will help promote healing and reduce the risk of complications.\n","7.

Nutrition: General Considerations\\nIntroduction\\nNutrition is the science of food and its relationship to health. Nutrients are chemicals in foods that are\\nused by the body for growth, maintenance, and energy. Nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the body\\nand thus must be derived from the diet are considered essential. They include vitamins, minerals, some\\namino acids, and some fatty acids. Nutrients that the body can synthesize from other compounds,\\nalthough they may also be derived from the diet, are considered nonessential. Macronutrients are\\nrequired by the body in relatively large amounts; micronutrients are needed in minute amounts.\\nLack of nutrients can result in deficiency syndromes (eg, kwashiorkor, pellagra) or other disorders (see p.\\n9). Excess intake of macronutrients can lead to obesity (see p. 56) and related disorders; excess intake of\\nmicro-nutrients can be toxic. Also, the balance of various types of nutrients, such as how much\\nusaturated vs saturated fat is consumed, can influence the development of disorders.\\nMacronutrients\\nMacronutrients constitute the bulk of the diet and supply energy and many essential nutrients.\\nCarbohydrates, proteins (including essential amino acids), fats (including essential fatty acids),\\nmacrominerals, and water are macronutrients. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are interchangeable as\\nsources of energy; fats yield 9 kcal/g (37.8 kJ/g); proteins and carbohydrates yield 4 kcal/g (16.8 kJ/g).\\nCarbohydrates: Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and other monosaccharides.\\nCarbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, supplying energy. Simple carbohydrates are composed of\\nsmall molecules, generally monosaccharides or disaccharides, which increase blood glucose levels\\nrapidly. Complex carbohydrates are composed of larger molecules, which are broken down into\\nmonosaccharides. Complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels more slowly but for a longer\\ntime. Glucose and sucrose are simple carbohydrates; starches and fiber are complex carbohydrates.\\nThe glycemic index measures how rapidly consumption of a carbohydrate increases plasma glucose\\nlevels. Values range from 1 (the slowest increase) to 100 (the fastest increase, equivalent to pure glucose\\n—see', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/ml_course/Section 5 Natural Language Processing/Project/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/drive/MyDrive/ml_course/Section 5 Natural Language Processing/Project/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'page': 62, 'total_pages': 4114, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Atop CHM to PDF Converter', 'producer': 'pdf-lib (https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib)', 'creationDate': 'D:20120615054440Z', 'modDate': 'D:20250523040747Z', 'trapped': ''})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["document_chunks[i+1]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lXNFIHOtKg-4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750535113627,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew T","userId":"09702362600588713674"}},"outputId":"fa0264e8-b0ec-4d83-b101-f490904da44b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Document(page_content='—see\\nTable 1-1). However, the actual rate of increase also depends on what foods are consumed with the\\ncarbohydrate.\\nCarbohydrates with a high glycemic index may increase plasma glucose to high levels rapidly. It is\\nhypothesized that, as a result, insulin levels increase, inducing hypoglycemia and hunger, which tends to\\nlead to consumption of excess calories and weight gain. Carbohydrates with a low glycemic index\\nincrease plasma glucose levels slowly, resulting in lower postprandial insulin levels and less hunger,\\nwhich probably makes consumption of excess calories less likely. These effects are predicted to result in\\na more favorable lipid profile and a decreased risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and complications of\\ndiabetes if present.\\nProteins: Dietary proteins are broken down into peptides and amino acids. Proteins are required for\\ntissue maintenance, replacement, function, and growth. However, if the body is not getting enough\\ncalories from dietary sources or tissue stores (particularly of fat), protein may be used for energy.\\nAs the body uses dietary protein for tissue production, there is a net gain of protein (positive nitrogen\\nbalance). During catabolic\\n[Table 1-1. Glycemic Index of Some Foods]\\nstates (eg, starvation, infections, burns), more protein may be used (because body tissues are broken\\ndown) than is absorbed, resulting in a net loss of protein (negative nitrogen balance).

- Critical Care Medicine\n","Chapter 222. Approach to the Critically Ill Patient\n","Introduction\n","Critical care medicine specializes in caring for the most seriously ill patients. These patients are best\n","treated in an ICU staffed by experienced personnel. Some hospitals maintain separate units for special\n","populations (eg, cardiac, surgical, neurologic, pediatric, or neonatal patients). ICUs have a high\n","nurse:patient ratio to provide the necessary high intensity of service, including treatment and monitoring\n","of physiologic parameters.\n","Supportive care for the ICU patient includes provision of adequate nutrition (see p. 21) and prevention of\n","infection, stress ulcers and gastritis (see p. 131), and pulmonary embolism (see p. 1920). Because 15 to\n","25% of patients admitted to ICUs die there, physicians should know how to minimize suffering and help\n","dying patients maintain dignity (see p. 3480).\n","Patient Monitoring and Testing\n","Some monitoring is manual (ie, by direct observation and physical examination) and intermittent, with the\n","frequency depending on the patient's illness. This monitoring usually includes measurement of vital signs\n","(temperature, BP, pulse, and respiration rate), quantification of all fluid intake and output, and often daily\n","weight. BP may be recorded by an automated sphygmomanometer; a transcutaneous sensor for pulse\n","oximetry is used as well.\n","Other monitoring is ongoing and continuous, provided by complex devices that require special training\n","and experience to operate. Most such devices generate an alarm if certain physiologic parameters are\n","exceeded. Every ICU should strictly follow protocols for investigating alarms.\n","Blood Tests\n","Although frequent blood draws can destroy veins, cause pain, and lead to anemia, ICU patients typically\n","have routine daily blood tests to help detect problems early. Generally, patients need a daily set of\n","electrolytes and a CBC. Patients with arrhythmias should also have Mg, phosphate, and Ca levels\n","measured. Patients receiving TPN need weekly liver enzymes and coagulation profiles. Other tests (eg,\n","blood culture for fever, CBC after a bleeding episode) are done as needed.\n","Point-of-care testing uses miniaturized, highly automated devices to do certain blood tests at the patient's\n","bedside or unit (particularly ICU, emergency department, and operating room). Commonly available tests\n","Parenteral antibiotics should be given after specimens of blood, body fluids, and wound sites have been\n","taken for Gram stain and culture. Very prompt empiric therapy, started immediately after suspecting\n","sepsis, is essential and may be lifesaving. Antibiotic selection requires an educated guess based on the\n","suspected source, clinical setting, knowledge or suspicion of causative organisms and of sensitivity\n","patterns common to that specific inpatient unit, and previous culture results.\n","One regimen for septic shock of unknown cause is gentamicin or tobramycin 5.1 mg/kg IV once/day plus\n","a 3rd-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime 2 g q 6 to 8 h or ceftriaxone 2 g once/day or, if Pseudomonas\n","is suspected, ceftazidime 2 g IV q 8 h). Alternatively, ceftazidime plus a fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin)\n","may be used. Monotherapy with maximal therapeutic doses of ceftazidime (2 g IV q 8 h) or imipenem (1 g\n","IV q 6 h) may be effective but is not recommended.\n","Vancomycin must be added if resistant staphylococci or enterococci are suspected. If there is an\n","abdominal source, a drug effective against anaerobes (eg, metronidazole) should be included. When\n","culture and sensitivity results are available, the antibiotic regimen is changed accordingly. Antibiotics are\n","continued for at least 5 days after shock resolves and evidence of infection subsides.\n","Abscesses must be drained, and necrotic tissues (eg, infarcted bowel, gangrenous gall-bladder,\n","abscessed uterus) must be surgically excised. The patient's condition will continue to deteriorate despite\n","antibiotic therapy unless septic foci are eliminated.\n","Normalization of blood glucose improves outcome in critically ill patients, even those not known to be\n","diabetic. A continuous IV insulin infusion (crystalline zinc 1 to 4 U/h) is titrated to maintain glucose\n","between 80 to 110 mg/dL (4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L). This approach necessitates frequent (eg, q 1 to 4 h)\n","glucose measurement.\n","glucose measurement.\n","Corticosteroid therapy seems beneficial. Treatment is with replacement doses rather than pharmacologic\n","doses. One regimen consists of hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q 6 h (or 100 mg q 8 h) plus fludrocortisone 50\n","μg po once/day during hemodynamic instability and for 3 days thereafter.\n","Activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa), a recombinant drug with fibrinolytic and anti-inflammatory activity,\n","seems beneficial for severe sepsis and septic shock if it is begun early; benefit has been shown only in\n","patients with significant risk of death as defined by an APACHE II score of > 25 (see\n","Table 222-4 on p. 2248). Dosage is 24 μg/kg/h by continuous IV infusion for 96 h. Bleeding is the most\n","common complication; thus, contraindications include hemorrhagic stroke within 3 mo, spinal or\n","intracranial surgery within 2 mo, acute trauma with a risk of bleeding, and intracranial neoplasm. Risk-\n","benefit assessment is required in other patients with increased risk of serious bleeding (eg, with\n","thrombocytopenia or recent GI bleeding, receiving concurrent heparin, or with recent aspirin or other\n","anticoagulant use).\n","Other emerging therapies for severe sepsis include cooling for hyperthermia and early treatment of renal\n","failure (eg, with continuous venovenous hemofiltration).\n","Trials of monoclonal antibodies to the lipid A fraction of endotoxin, antileukotrienes, and antibodies to\n","tumor necrosis factor have been unsuccessful.\n","The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\n","Chapter 227.

Therefore, I would rate the answer as a 4 out of 5 in terms of relevance to the question.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["groundedness_report_5, relevance_report_5 = generate_ground_relevance_response(queries[4],k=6)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"SxDBgFcLM61w","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750540308186,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":757937,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew T","userId":"09702362600588713674"}},"outputId":"6539793c-a76c-48b9-bcc5-4d6eb7104aac"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Llama.generate: prefix-match hit\n","Llama.generate: prefix-match hit\n","Llama.generate: prefix-match hit\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(groundedness_report_5, '\\n\\n', relevance_report_5)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nBygsQxvM-eM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750540308197,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew T","userId":"09702362600588713674"}},"outputId":"ecbef1e3-8931-4cd9-8915-75421778f1b3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  Based on the provided context, I would rate the answer as follows:\n","\n","Rating: 4 (out of 5)\n","\n","The answer provides a comprehensive list of necessary precautions and treatment steps for a person who has fractured their leg during a hiking trip.
